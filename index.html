            ey folks! I hope that you are safe and doing well in this quarantine. These times are hard and one thing that we all must know is that we are strong then this together. We are in this together. Look out for each other and help your elders so that they
            are safe as they are more vulnerable to this situation. The beginning was hard for me, I felt trapped inside. I am not fond of travelling but I will say I don't like being trapped inside either.
            <br> You might feel these as well. But we can't waste this precious time. Try to utilize this time by talking to your family. I will say socialise with them at this moment which we all were missing due to the hectic schedule we all had. You
            can also learn a new skill, something that you wanted to do for a long time. Don't allow this situation to come in the way of learning. Own your knowledge and never be dependent on anyone for knowledge. I know saying these motivational words
            is easy and following them is quite hard, but if we want to learn something we will do it regardless of the situation. And in the end I will say

            <div class="finalPara">
                Stay safe, Peace!

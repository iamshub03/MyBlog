                Procrastination can change your life for worse if you don't stop it in time. It is a very common problem for anyone and the biggest part about it that most of the people don't even know that they are suffering from it. For instance, I am still suffering
                from it and here I am writing about how to stop it. You might be wondering how a person who is still influenced by procrastination can guide you the path to end it? I will say bear with me and you might learn a thing or two from my experiences
                on how to fight it. Before curing any disease you must diagnose it and it works on procrastination too. You might be wondering how the heck you are going to diagnose yourself. Just check that are you disobeying your workflow or routine
                to binge-watch a show or scroll through social media? Are you avoiding your tasks or projects until the deadline is the next day? You don't feel like doing it anything related to work or school? If the answer for any of these questions
                is yes then my friend you are suffering from procrastination and you need to destroy it before it destroys your life.

                So what now, how can a person who is not over something, guide another person to get over it? The answer is simple, I will tell you the path that I am not able to cross yet and maybe you can cross it before me. For me, the problem was that I was not interested
                in the chores that were given by my teachers (as I am a student :( ). The things that I wanted to learn were not even the part of my curriculum which I signed for. They were teaching subjects that were out of my interest like Engineering
                Drawing, Basics of Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry and so on ( I signed for Computer Science, sed life). Anyhow, I was not doing good in subjects that were a part of my core interests and that's when I realize that I was/am living with
                procrastination. I tried to watch a lot of videos and tutorials on how to avoid it and start working on something which inspires me or calls me. That's when I recognized the difference between studying and learning. Studying was boring,
                like making assignments or completing files which will be thrown out at the end of the sem. But on the other hand, learning is beautiful. There were no restrictions, I was doing whatever I wanted to. I was not forced by anyone to do anything.
                That's when I realised that I can do something for a long time. The solution for procrastination is to find the things that you love to learn. Once you find you it, you will start avoiding it.

            <div class="finalContent">
                That's it, the only solution that I was able to find for this problem is doing what you love or love what you do. Before starting anything, ask yourself this question: Why I am doing this? If the answer is something which you are not passionate about,
                then you should probably stay away from it (until it is an assignment that you need to complete otherwise you will fail in the exam).
